    "\n",
    "- Conditionals are introduced as a means to add intelligence and interactivity to the Python programs. They allow your code to respond differently based on varying conditions and input.\n",
    "- The basic form of conditional execution is demonstrated using the \"if\" statement. It is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is met.\n",
    "- When you need to provide an alternative course of action when a condition is not met, the \"if-else\" statement is used.\n",
    "- For scenarios with multiple conditions to check, the \"elif\" (else if) clause is introduced. This allows you to test multiple conditions sequentially and execute the code block associated with the first true condition.\n",
    "- Logical operators such as \"and,\" \"or,\" and \"not\" are introduced to combine conditions and create more complex conditional statements.\n",
    "- To nest conditionals, you need to place one \"if\" statement inside another. This technique allows for the creation of more intricate decision-making processes.\n",
    "- Python's ternary conditional expression is presented as a concise way to express conditionals in a single line. This is particularly useful when assigning a value based on a condition.\n",
