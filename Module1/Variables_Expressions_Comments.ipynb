They are purely for human readability and understanding. Comments are a helpful way to document your code and make it more comprehensible. There are:\n",
    "- Single-line comments begin that with a # symbol and extend until the end of the line. They are used to provide brief explanations, clarifications, or context for a single line of code.\n",
    "- Multi-line comments are enclosed in triple-quotes (\"\"\" \"\"\") and can span multiple lines. They are typically used for more extensive explanations or documentation of code blocks, functions, or entire programs."
