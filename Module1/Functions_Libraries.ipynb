    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will discuss two essential aspects of Python programming: functions and libraries. We will: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Encapsulate the unique logic behind creating and applying functions in Python. \n",
    "- Learn how to customize function parameters.\n",
    "- Explore commonly used Python libraries, such NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-Requisites\n",
    "- Python Environment: You should have a Python environment set up on your system. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). We recommend downloading Python 3.8 or above.\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook: This code is intended to be run in a Jupyter Notebook environment. Make sure you have [Jupyter Notebook installed](https://jupyter.org/install).\n",
    "- Library Installation: We will be using the NumPy library. If you have not previously installed then use **\"!pip3 install numpy\"** to install the library within your Jupyter notebook. \n"
