Ingredients:

1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 cup granulated sugar
1 cup almond flour
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup finely chopped almonds
Sliced almonds for decoration (optional)
Powdered sugar for dusting (optional)
Instructions:

Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Cream the Butter and Sugar: In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter and granulated sugar together until it becomes creamy and light in color, about 2-3 minutes.

Add Almond and Vanilla Extracts: Mix in the almond and vanilla extracts, continuing to beat until well combined.

Combine Dry Ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the almond flour, all-purpose flour, and salt.

Mix Dry Ingredients with Butter Mixture: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. Be careful not to overmix.

Add Chopped Almonds: Fold in the finely chopped almonds to the dough, distributing them evenly.

Shape the Cookies: Take small portions of the dough and roll them into 1-inch balls. Place them on the prepared baking sheet, leaving some space between each cookie. If desired, press a sliced almond into the center of each cookie for decoration.

Bake: Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges of the cookies start to turn golden brown.

Cool: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

Optional Dusting: Once the cookies have cooled, you can dust them with powdered sugar for extra sweetness.

Serve: Your almond cookies are ready to be enjoyed! Store any leftovers in an airtight container to maintain their freshness.

These almond cookies are perfect for tea time, dessert, or as a sweet treat anytime. Enjoy!
